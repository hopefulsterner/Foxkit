{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"temporary value dropped while borrowed","code":{"code":"E0716","explanation":"A temporary value is being dropped while a borrow is still in active use.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0716\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nfn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet p = bar(&foo());\n         // ------ creates a temporary\nlet q = *p;\n```\n\nHere, the expression `&foo()` is borrowing the expression `foo()`. As `foo()` is\na call to a function, and not the name of a variable, this creates a\n**temporary** -- that temporary stores the return value from `foo()` so that it\ncan be borrowed. You could imagine that `let p = bar(&foo());` is equivalent to\nthe following, which uses an explicit temporary variable.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0597\n# fn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\n# fn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet p = {\n  let tmp = foo(); // the temporary\n  bar(&tmp) // error: `tmp` does not live long enough\n}; // <-- tmp is freed as we exit this block\nlet q = p;\n```\n\nWhenever a temporary is created, it is automatically dropped (freed) according\nto fixed rules. Ordinarily, the temporary is dropped at the end of the enclosing\nstatement -- in this case, after the `let p`. This is illustrated in the example\nabove by showing that `tmp` would be freed as we exit the block.\n\nTo fix this problem, you need to create a local variable to store the value in\nrather than relying on a temporary. For example, you might change the original\nprogram to the following:\n\n```\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nfn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet value = foo(); // dropped at the end of the enclosing block\nlet p = bar(&value);\nlet q = *p;\n```\n\nBy introducing the explicit `let value`, we allocate storage that will last\nuntil the end of the enclosing block (when `value` goes out of scope). When we\nborrow `&value`, we are borrowing a local variable that already exists, and\nhence no temporary is created.\n\nTemporaries are not always dropped at the end of the enclosing statement. In\nsimple cases where the `&` expression is immediately stored into a variable, the\ncompiler will automatically extend the lifetime of the temporary until the end\nof the enclosing block. Therefore, an alternative way to fix the original\nprogram is to write `let tmp = &foo()` and not `let tmp = foo()`:\n\n```\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nfn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet value = &foo();\nlet p = bar(value);\nlet q = *p;\n```\n\nHere, we are still borrowing `foo()`, but as the borrow is assigned directly\ninto a variable, the temporary will not be dropped until the end of the\nenclosing block. Similar rules apply when temporaries are stored into aggregate\nstructures like a tuple or struct:\n\n```\n// Here, two temporaries are created, but\n// as they are stored directly into `value`,\n// they are not dropped until the end of the\n// enclosing block.\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nlet value = (&foo(), &foo());\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"crates/keybindings/src/chord.rs","byte_start":457,"byte_end":473,"line_start":20,"line_end":20,"column_start":32,"column_end":48,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        let parts: Vec<&str> = s.to_lowercase().split('+').collect();","highlight_start":32,"highlight_end":48}],"label":"creates a temporary value which is freed while still in use","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"crates/keybindings/src/chord.rs","byte_start":494,"byte_end":495,"line_start":20,"line_end":20,"column_start":69,"column_end":70,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        let parts: Vec<&str> = s.to_lowercase().split('+').collect();","highlight_start":69,"highlight_end":70}],"label":"temporary value is freed at the end of this statement","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"crates/keybindings/src/chord.rs","byte_start":507,"byte_end":512,"line_start":21,"line_end":21,"column_start":12,"column_end":17,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        if parts.is_empty() {","highlight_start":12,"highlight_end":17}],"label":"borrow later used here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"crates/keybindings/src/chord.rs","byte_start":434,"byte_end":434,"line_start":20,"line_end":20,"column_start":9,"column_end":9,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        let parts: Vec<&str> = s.to_lowercase().split('+').collect();","highlight_start":9,"highlight_end":9}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"let binding = s.to_lowercase();\n        ","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null},{"file_name":"crates/keybindings/src/chord.rs","byte_start":457,"byte_end":473,"line_start":20,"line_end":20,"column_start":32,"column_end":48,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        let parts: Vec<&str> = s.to_lowercase().split('+').collect();","highlight_start":32,"highlight_end":48}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"binding","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0716]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: temporary value dropped while borrowed\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0mcrates/keybindings/src/chord.rs:20:32\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m20\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         let parts: Vec<&str> = s.to_lowercase().split('+').collect();\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m                     \u001b[1m\u001b[94m-\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94mtemporary value is freed at the end of this statement\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                \u001b[1m\u001b[91m|\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                \u001b[1m\u001b[91mcreates a temporary value which is freed while still in use\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m21\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         if parts.is_empty() {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m            \u001b[1m\u001b[94m-----\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94mborrow later used here\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m20\u001b[0m \u001b[92m~ \u001b[0m        \u001b[92mlet binding = s.to_lowercase();\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m21\u001b[0m \u001b[92m~         \u001b[0mlet parts: Vec<&str> = \u001b[92mbinding\u001b[0m.split('+').collect();\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\n"}
